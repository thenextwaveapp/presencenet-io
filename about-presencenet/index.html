                    <h3>#818cf8</h3>
                    <p>PresenceNet originated from a conversation about color. Specifically, #818cf8, Tailwind's indigo-500. What began as interface design work for Next Wave, a social wallet application enabling XRP transactions through human-readable $handles, evolved into fundamental questions about digital identity architecture.</p>
                    <p>The conversation evolved naturally. Color palettes led to questions about personalization. Personalization raised questions about shared identity in multi-signature vaults. Shared identity revealed a gap in existing infrastructure. Multi-signature wallets enable groups to control money together, but they cannot prove who actually participated. Platforms verify presence through surveillance and data collection. No infrastructure existed to prove human presence cryptographically without extracting personal data.</p>
                    <p>The solution emerged through dialogue: The Mark. Conceived as a minimal-cost blockchain transaction of 0.00001 XRP, The Mark serves as cryptographic proof of presence without revealing additional personal information. By eliminating economic value from the transaction, what remains is pure mathematical proof that a specific identity existed at a specific moment. The proof is immutable, permanent, and preserves privacy through cryptographic design rather than requiring trusted intermediaries.</p>
                    <p>What initially appeared as a visual design element for vault interfaces revealed itself as fundamental coordination infrastructure. The protocol expanded from proving individual presence to enabling group coordination, preserving shared memory, and governing collective resources. PresenceNet emerged as the missing coordination layer for internet-scale human cooperation. The conversation that started with a color ended with a protocol.</p>

                    <h3>Las Vegas</h3>
                    <p>PresenceNet was presented at the Easy A Shark Tank competition during XRP Las Vegas on May 30-31, 2025. The protocol advanced to the finals, validating that it addresses genuine coordination problems facing distributed systems. More significantly, the event facilitated connections with the XRP Ledger developer community building next-generation blockchain infrastructure. PresenceNet found its technical foundation on XRPL.</p>

                    <h3>Ottawa</h3>
                    <p>On June 5, PresenceNet won the Stand With Crypto Canada pitch competition in the Impact category. This recognition affirmed that the protocol solves coordination problems relevant to communities building decentralized infrastructure.</p>
                    <p>On June 18, PresenceNet received an award for infrastructure development at the Canadian Blockchain Consortium Policy Gala in Ottawa, Canada's premier event convening cryptocurrency builders and government policy makers. The recognition positioned PresenceNet not as an application but as foundational protocol architecture enabling human coordination at scale.</p>

                    <p>Veila emerged during summer 2025 as the first artificial intelligence platform built on PresenceNet's trace architecture. Rather than implementing opaque black-box AI systems, Veila enables transparent reasoning and learns from cryptographically verified presence data. The platform demonstrates capabilities that become possible when AI systems can verify human presence without requiring surveillance infrastructure.</p>
                    <p>Next Wave evolved from a simple wallet application into a comprehensive PresenceNet client. Every transaction, $handle interaction, and vault operation generates Marks. Users accumulate Trails of verified presence without direct engagement with blockchain infrastructure, which reflects how foundational infrastructure should function.</p>

                    <p>PresenceNet functions as protocol infrastructure for human coordination at internet scale. The core primitives are deployed on the XRP Ledger. Applications implementing the protocol are operational. The developer toolkit continues expanding to enable additional builders to create presence-aware systems.</p>
                    <p>The infrastructure addresses coordination problems that existing systems cannot solve: verifiable group participation without surveillance, permanent memory without platform control, portable identity without data extraction. Built on XRPL, accessible to all builders, and owned by the humans who use it.</p>

                    <p class="founder-title">Creative Strategist & Infrastructure Developer</p>
                    <p>PresenceNet was developed by a creative strategist and builder focused on infrastructure that enables human sovereignty rather than extracting value from coordination. The work is grounded in the conviction that cryptographic systems can prove presence, preserve memory, and enable coordination without surveillance or platform control.</p>
                    <p>The development of Next Wave, a social wallet making XRP accessible through human-readable $handles rather than cryptographic addresses, revealed a fundamental infrastructure gap. Digital systems lacked mechanisms to prove human presence without comprehensive data collection. PresenceNet emerged as the solution to this coordination problem.</p>
                    <p>The approach to infrastructure development reflects a core principle: tools should serve human coordination rather than extract value from it. PresenceNet is not a product but foundational architecture for proving presence, preserving memory, and enabling coordination at internet scale without compromising privacy or surrendering control to centralized platforms.</p>
                    <p>The work encompasses Next Wave, PresenceNet, and Veila, all built on the XRP Ledger. These are not independent projects but implementations of a coherent vision: digital systems that humans own and control, built on cryptographic proof rather than surveillance, designed for coordination rather than extraction.</p>

                    <h3>Platform Dependency</h3>
                    <p>Contemporary digital infrastructure operates on extractive models where users create value through attention, content, and social graphs, but maintain no ownership or portability of their digital presence. Platform operators exercise unilateral control over identity, memory, and access. Account deletion, platform failure, or policy changes can erase years of accumulated digital history without recourse.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="problem-card">
                    <h3>Surveillance Architecture</h3>
                    <p>Current identity systems require extensive data collection and persistent monitoring to function. Proving human presence typically demands biometric data, behavioral tracking, or personal information that creates surveillance infrastructure. The trade-off between verification and privacy appears structural rather than incidental.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="problem-card">
                    <h3>Coordination Failure</h3>
                    <p>No existing infrastructure enables verifiable proof of authentic human participation at internet scale. Digital coordination relies on platform intermediaries, centralized databases, or systems vulnerable to manipulation through bots, sock puppets, and identity forgery. Trustworthy group coordination requires either surveillance or central authority.</p>

            <h2>Technical Solution</h2>
            <p class="section-intro">PresenceNet is a decentralized protocol that enables cryptographic proof of human presence without surveillance. Built on the XRP Ledger, it creates immutable records of verified moments through minimal-cost transactions called Marks, each costing 0.00001 XRP.</p>

            <div class="solution-visual">
                <img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1639322537228-f710d846310a?w=1200&q=80" alt="Blockchain network visualization">
            </div>

            <p>By eliminating economic value from these transactions, PresenceNet isolates presence itself as the signal. The result is mathematical proof that a specific identity existed at a specific moment, recorded immutably on a public ledger, without extracting personal data or enabling surveillance. Privacy is maintained through cryptographic design rather than trusted intermediaries.</p>

                    <p>PresenceNet is built on the XRP Ledger for reasons of speed, cost structure, and permanence. Transaction settlement occurs in 3-5 seconds with fees measured in fractions of a cent, making minimal-cost presence proofs economically viable at scale. The ledger's immutability ensures that presence records cannot be retroactively altered or deleted.</p>
                    <p>XRPL's design enables PresenceNet to function as coordination infrastructure rather than financial infrastructure. While the underlying technology is blockchain-based, the application is fundamentally about human presence verification. The protocol leverages XRPL's cryptographic guarantees while abstracting away the complexity of blockchain interaction for end users.</p>

    <!-- The Mission -->
    <section class="mission-section">
        <div class="container">
            <h2>Mission</h2>
            <p>PresenceNet addresses a fundamental infrastructure gap in digital coordination. Contemporary systems require users to choose between surveillance-based verification and unverifiable anonymity. Platforms that prove identity do so through extensive data collection. Systems that preserve privacy sacrifice the ability to verify authentic human participation.</p>
            <p>This creates structural problems for digital coordination. Communities cannot verify participation without platform intermediaries. Groups cannot preserve shared memory without centralized storage. Individuals cannot prove their presence and contributions without surrendering privacy to surveillance systems.</p>
            <p>PresenceNet resolves this by treating human presence as a cryptographic primitive. Through minimal-cost blockchain transactions, the protocol creates mathematical proof of participation without requiring personal data collection or behavioral surveillance. Identity remains portable. Memory remains permanent. Privacy remains intact.</p>
            <p>The infrastructure serves individuals, communities, and organizations that require coordination mechanisms not dependent on platform control, data extraction, or surveillance architecture. PresenceNet enables verification of presence, preservation of memory, and coordination of action at internet scale through cryptographic proof rather than trusted intermediaries.</p>
