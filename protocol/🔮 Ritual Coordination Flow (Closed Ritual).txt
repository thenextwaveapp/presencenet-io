🔮 Ritual Coordination Flow (Closed Ritual)
A cryptographically verified, presence-based interaction between a creator and selected participants, with optional gated access through a chamber.
1. Creation (Ritual Definition)
The ritual creator defines a Ritual Object with the following parameters:
* ritual_id: A unique identifier
* start_time and end_time: A defined time window for the ritual
* invited_handles: A list of eligible participants
* required_mark_target: A destination subhandle (e.g., $mayowa~presence) that participants must mark
* completion_condition: Rules for what qualifies as a successful ritual (e.g., single mark, quorum, etc.)
* (Optional) linked_chamber: A vault, object, or action that is unlocked upon completion
The Ritual Object is published to PresenceNet, stored either on-chain or in a decentralized state layer.
________________


2. Invitation & Acceptance (Commitment Phase)
Participants on the invited list receive the ritual metadata, typically through an interface or notification.
To join, a participant must explicitly accept the ritual before it begins. Once accepted, their interface displays instructions like:
“Mark $ritualhost~subhandle between [start_time] and [end_time].”
Once accepted, the ritual is considered active between the creator and that participant.
________________


3. Marking (Witness Phase)
The participant submits a mark by sending a cryptographically signed transaction or message to the required subhandle.
This must be done within the ritual’s active time window.
The mark serves as:
* A proof of presence (may include biometric, location, or manual signing)
* A timestamped witness of participation
* A voluntary, intentional action — it is never automated
________________


4. Completion Mark (Verification & Sealing)
The ritual creator (or an automated system) verifies the participant’s mark and, if valid, issues a completion mark in return.
The completion mark:
* Is signed by the creator’s subhandle or a neutral ritual authority
* Includes:
   * ritual_id
   * completion_timestamp
   * (Optional) metadata (score, approval, role, etc.)
This mark is the formal acknowledgment:
“You fulfilled the ritual. Your presence is sealed.”
________________


5. Chamber Access (Optional Reward or Unlock)
Once the completion mark is received, the participant may gain access to a linked chamber — a gated resource or symbolic artifact tied to the ritual.
Chamber types may include:
* Shared Vault: A multi-signature vault with access rules
* Symbolic Object: A dynamic NFT, encrypted file, or media artifact
* Social Action: Permissions like minting, voting, or inviting others
* Continuity Ritual: The right to create or join a future ritual
The chamber is a sealed space that only opens through verified presence. It cannot be accessed through clicks or tokens alone.

⛩️ Chamber as a Space
The chamber is more than a reward — it is the space generated by the ritual. It may act as:
* A programmable vault
* A temporary shared room (e.g., XRPL address, private channel)
* A digital altar that reflects all marks made
* A symbolic gate, with the completion mark as the key

🔁 Flow Summary
1. Define — Creator sets ritual parameters
2. Invite & Accept — Participants commit
3. Mark — Participants submit proof of presence
4. Verify & Seal — Completion mark is issued
5. Access Chamber — Optional access to gated resource or next step
This foundational flow ties together presence, proof, coordination, and reward through simple, time-bound rituals. The completion mark becomes both a seal of memory and a key to continuity.
