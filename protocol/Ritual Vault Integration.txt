🔐 Ritual → Vault Integration
How Rituals Unlock and Govern Vaults in PresenceNet
In PresenceNet, Vaults are multi-user XRPL wallets governed by presence-based rules. Rituals are the coordination layer that determine who may access, sign for, or alter these vaults — based on verified memory and trail state.

🧭 Integration Modes
Here are the five supported patterns for ritual-to-vault interaction:
________________


1. Ritual-as-Key
Use Case: Unlocking access to a vault after presence is verified
When a ritual is completed, the user is granted access to a specific vault.
* Trigger: on_completion → grant_vault_access(vault_id)

* Can be configured in the ritual definition

* Access may be temporary or permanent based on ritual rules

Example:
Complete the “Circle Ritual” → unlock the shared vault $creativevault
Common Uses:
   * Initiation sequences

   * Time-based access gates

   * Community onboarding

   * Chamber-to-vault transitions

________________


2. Ritual-as-Signature
Use Case: Using marks as multi-sig signatures for proposals
Each qualifying mark within a ritual counts as a valid vault signature toward a proposal (e.g. fund release, config change).
      * Vault checks that a threshold number of ritual marks are present

      * Ritual effectively acts as a proxy signer system

Example:
All 3 mentors mark a ritual → their signatures count toward a vault release action
Common Uses:
         * Group voting

         * Collaborative funding

         * Governance flows

3. Ritual-as-Condition
Use Case: Vault remains locked until ritual prerequisites are fulfilled
Vault access is conditionally tied to the completion of specific rituals or trail states.
            * Ritual Completion Marks are evaluated by the vault’s access_conditions

            * Vault remains invisible or sealed until met

Example:
“Vault of the Ancients” only unlocks if user has completed all of:
               * Initiation

               * Guardian

               * Memorial

Common Uses:
                  * Lore-based access control

                  * Trail-based privileges

                  * Hierarchical or spiritual unlocks

________________


4. Ritual-as-Artifact
Use Case: Writing memory into the vault trail through ritual participation
Instead of unlocking the vault, the ritual writes a symbolic or informational artifact into the vault record.
                     * Each Completion Mark contributes a “memory entry”

                     * Used for scrolls, letters, dedications, or collaborative journals

Example:
Completing “Solitude Ritual” → your private reflection is stored in vault_journal
Common Uses:
                        * Collaborative storytelling

                        * Legacy deposits

                        * Memory walls

Note:
In v0.2+, this is better handled through Chambers unless financial coordination is needed.

5. Ritual-as-Governor
Use Case: Rituals required to alter vault rules or structure
Some vault configuration changes (e.g. threshold adjustment, adding/removing members) can only occur if a specific ritual is completed.
                           * Vault checks for valid Completion Marks before allowing sensitive actions

                           * Admin rights are replaced with presence-based consent

Example:
“To update the vault’s threshold, the ‘Circle of Consensus’ ritual must be completed”
Common Uses:
                              * Decentralized upgrades

                              * Safe governance

                              * Ritual-driven DAO mechanics
