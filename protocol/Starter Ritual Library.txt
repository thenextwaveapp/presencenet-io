Here’s the **Starter Ritual Library** for PresenceNet v1.1 – three foundational rituals designed to onboard users, coordinate groups, and immortalize moments. Each includes a **JSON schema**, **use case**, and **developer snippet**:


---


### **1. Initiation Ritual**  
*(Solo, Trail-Starting)*  
**Purpose**: Anchor a new user’s first mark in their trail.  
```json
{
  "ritual_id": "initiation_v1",
  "ritual_archetype": "solo",
  "host_handle": "$witness",
  "participant_handles": ["$newuser"],
  "required_mark_target": "$witness~presence",
  "biometric_required": true,
  "completion_condition": "minimum_marks: 1",
  "ritual_weight": 100,
  "completion_memo_template": "⚡ $newuser began their trail."
}
```
**Use Case**:  
- New users prove humanity (biometric) and get a `trail_weight` boost.  
- Unlocks eligibility for advanced rituals.  


**Dev Snippet**:  
```javascript
// Submit mark via SDK
submitMark({
  ritual_id: "initiation_v1",
  from: "$newuser",
  to: "$witness~presence",
  payload: { biometric_hash: "0xabc..." }
});
```


---


### **2. Circle Ritual**  
*(Group, Time-Bound)*  
**Purpose**: Coordinate collective presence to unlock shared assets.  
```json
{
  "ritual_id": "circle_v1",
  "ritual_archetype": "circle",
  "host_handle": "$host",
  "participant_handles": ["$alice", "$bob", "$mira"],
  "start_time": "2025-06-01T18:00:00Z",
  "end_time": "2025-06-01T20:00:00Z",
  "required_mark_target": "$host~presence",
  "completion_condition": "minimum_marks: 3",
  "linked_chamber": "vault:shared_funds",
  "completion_memo_template": "🌀 Circle completed. Vault unlocked."
}
```
**Use Case**:  
- 3/4 participants mark presence to unlock a multi-sig vault.  
- Ideal for DAO meetings or family treasuries.  


**Dev Snippet**:  
```python
# Check completion
if getTrail("$alice").hasMark("circle_v1"):
    unlockVault("vault:shared_funds");
```


---


### **3. Memorial Ritual**  
*(Open, Immutable)*  
**Purpose**: Preserve a moment without coordination.  
```json
{
  "ritual_id": "memorial_v1",
  "ritual_archetype": "open",
  "host_handle": "$creator",
  "participant_handles": null,
  "ritual_window": "indefinite",
  "required_mark_target": "$event~memory",
  "memo_allowed": true,
  "memory_archive_target": "ipfs://Qm...",
  "completion_memo_template": "🌌 Marked by $user: '$memo'"
}
```
**Use Case**:  
- Decentralized guestbook for events, losses, or protests.  
- Memos archived to IPFS for tamper-proof memory.  


**Dev Snippet**:  
```bash
# CLI mark submission
presencenet-cli submit-mark \
  --ritual memorial_v1 \
  --to "$event~memory" \
  --memo "We were here."
```


---


### **Deploying the Library**  
1. **Host Rituals**: Publish JSON to IPFS/Firestore.  
2. **Integrate SDK**: Use `@presencenet/sdk` to:  
   - Create rituals: `deployRitual(initiation_json)`  
   - Listen for completions: `onRitualComplete("circle_v1", unlockVault)`  
3. **Add UI Templates**:  
   - "Start a Circle" flow in your app.  
   - "Mark Your Memorial" public page.  


**Why This Matters**:  
- **Low friction**: Solos, groups, and open rituals cover 80% of use cases.  
- **Composable**: Build quests like `initiation → circle → guardian`.  


Need a **quickstart GitHub repo** with these rituals pre-loaded? I can draft the `README.md` and example scripts.
